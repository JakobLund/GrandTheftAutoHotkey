+ If you want the interaction menu to work while being CEO or MC president then you'll have to register with this program. This way it will know how to navigate the menu.
+ Interactive menu does not work while being inside most properties, only the phone will work.
+ If you want to force a solo lobby you need to have [pssuspend.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pssuspend) added to your path
